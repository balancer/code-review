## Context
EVK (Euler Vault Kit) vaults are extended ERC-4626 vaults that function as passive lending pools. Unlike standard ERC-4626 vaults that generate yield through active investment strategies, EVK vaults earn yield by lending assets to borrowers. These vaults accept ERC-20 token deposits and enable users to borrow against their collateral.

## Review Checklist: Bare Minimum Compatibility
Each of the items below represents an absolute requirement for the Rate Provider. If any of these is unchecked, the Rate Provider is unfit to use.

- [x] Tests based on the [balancer-v3-monorepo](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/tree/main/pkg/vault/test/foundry/fork) pass for the given ERC4626 vaults, which can be found [here](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-erc4626-tests/tree/main/test).
- [x] The required Vault implements the required operational ERC4626 Interface

### Administrative Privileges
- [x] The ERC4626 Vault is upgradeable** (e.g., via a proxy architecture).
- [x] Other contracts which are part of the `mint` callchain are upgradeable**. You can find more information
   about the involved contracts in this [tenderly simulation](https://www.tdly.co/shared/simulation/adfbce70-a91a-4412-bb81-e794af12a8ce)

## Conclusion
**Summary judgment: USABLE**
Passing fork tests can be found here: https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-erc4626-tests/pull/61/files 

** upgradeable in this context means that:
- The contract is a proxy contract with an implementation sourced from Etherscan.
