Earn vaults are designed for passive yield seekers who want exposure to the Euler ecosystem without managing individual lending and borrowing positions. Built on the ERC-4626 standard,these vaults act as yield aggregators,deploying user deposits across multiple strategies selected and managed by risk curators.

## Review Checklist: Bare Minimum Compatibility
Each of the items below represents an absolute requirement for the Rate Provider. If any of these is unchecked, the Rate Provider is unfit to use.

- [x] Tests based on the [balancer-v3-monorepo](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/tree/main/pkg/vault/test/foundry/fork) pass for the given ERC4626 vaults, which can be found [here](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-erc4626-tests/tree/main/test).
- [x] The required Vault implements the required operational ERC4626 Interface

### Administrative Privileges
- [ ] The ERC4626 Vault is upgradeable** (e.g., via a proxy architecture).
- [x] Other contracts which are part of the `mint` callchain are upgradeable**. You can find more information
   about the involved contracts in this [tenderly simulation](https://www.tdly.co/shared/simulation/c46a9b20-bc36-428c-9fa4-1a0f335ca5f5)

## Conclusion
**Summary judgment: USABLE**
Passing fork tests can be found at https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-erc4626-tests/pull/100.

** upgradeable in this context means that:
