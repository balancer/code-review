Earn vaults are designed for passive yield seekers who want exposure to the Euler ecosystem without managing individual lending and borrowing positions. Built on the ERC-4626 standard,these vaults act as yield aggregators,deploying user deposits across multiple strategies selected and managed by risk curators.
