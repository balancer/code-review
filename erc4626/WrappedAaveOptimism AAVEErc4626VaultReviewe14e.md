## Context
A 4626 Vault which wraps aTokens in order to translate the rebasing nature of yield accrual into a non-rebasing value accrual.

## Review Checklist: Bare Minimum Compatibility
Each of the items below represents an absolute requirement for the Rate Provider. If any of these is unchecked, the Rate Provider is unfit to use.

- [ ] Tests based on the [balancer-v3-monorepo](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/tree/main/pkg/vault/test/foundry/fork) pass for the given ERC4626 vaults, which can be found [here](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-erc4626-tests/tree/main/test).
- [ ] The required Vault implements the required operational ERC4626 Interface

### Administrative Privileges
- [ ] The ERC4626 Vault is upgradeable** (e.g., via a proxy architecture).
- [x] Other contracts which are part of the `mint` callchain are upgradeable**. You can find more information
   about the involved contracts in this [tenderly simulation](https://www.tdly.co/shared/simulation/d09063de-b2d3-4cca-b4b9-13e86bac5a27)

## Conclusion
**Summary judgment: USABLE/UNUSABLE**

** upgradeable in this context means that:
- The contract is a proxy contract with an implementation sourced from Etherscan.
