## Context
Curvance structures assets into isolated markets based on risk profile and liquidity depth. Each market operates with its own collateral caps and configuration parameters,allowing us to safely support leverage on assets like WETH,WBTC,and Monad LSTs without exposing the broader system to concentrated risk.
