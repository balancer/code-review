## Context
Staking is controlled by the StakedUSDX smart contract. Stakers can interact with it directly or through https://usdx.money/stake.
When staking, a user transfers USDX into the contract and receives sUSDX (staked USDX), another ERC20 token that represents a fractional interest in the USDX in the contract.
Over time, a portion of protocol revenue accumulates in the staking contract as additional USDX is transferred in.
When unstaking, sUSDX is burned in exchange for a proportionate USDX amount. For faster conversion into aforementioned stablecoins, users can swap sUSDX into USDX through liquidity pools (LPs).

## Review Checklist: Bare Minimum Compatibility
Each of the items below represents an absolute requirement for the Rate Provider. If any of these is unchecked, the Rate Provider is unfit to use.

- [x] Implements the [`IRateProvider`](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/bc3b3fee6e13e01d2efe610ed8118fdb74dfc1f2/pkg/interfaces/contracts/pool-utils/IRateProvider.sol) interface.
- [x] `getRate` returns an 18-decimal fixed point number (i.e., 1 == 1e18) regardless of underlying token decimals.

### Administrative Privileges
- [ ] The Rate Provider is upgradeable** (e.g., via a proxy architecture).
- [ ] Other contracts which are part of the `getRate` callchain are upgradeable**. You can find more information
   about the involved contracts in this [tenderly simulation](https://www.tdly.co/shared/simulation/cf68cdb6-3b1a-4872-b4e0-079baf98781a)

## Conclusion
**Summary judgment: USABLE**

** upgradeable in this context means that:
- The contract is a proxy contract with an implementation sourced from Etherscan and the proxy emitted an "Upgraded" event.
