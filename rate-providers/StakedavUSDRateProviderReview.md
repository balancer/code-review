## Context
The savUSD Rate provider pertains to the staking contract for Avant USD (avUSD). The staking contract has a cool down or timelock prevent atomic unstaking, meaning this asset cannot be used as a boosted type.
The buffer has been [seeded](https://snowtrace.io/tx/0x27edceb760ed7fefade51de6d0091c31c2cf559cc748b7b5c947cd41b71fcf8a?chainid=43114) to remedy any security and integration concerns. The savUSD token will be used to provide LPs a yield bearing stablecoin as a default swap path.

- [x] Implements the [`IRateProvider`](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/bc3b3fee6e13e01d2efe610ed8118fdb74dfc1f2/pkg/interfaces/contracts/pool-utils/IRateProvider.sol) interface.
- [x] `getRate` returns an 18-decimal fixed point number (i.e., 1 == 1e18) regardless of underlying token decimals.

### Administrative Privileges
- [ ] The Rate Provider is upgradeable** (e.g., via a proxy architecture).
- [ ] Other contracts which are part of the `getRate` callchain are upgradeable**. You can find more information
   about the involved contracts in this [tenderly simulation](https://www.tdly.co/shared/simulation/6ae6e8f3-cda5-4869-b4da-bb1dccf6710c)
