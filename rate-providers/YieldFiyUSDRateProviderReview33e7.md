## Context
YToken Vaults form the foundation of the YieldFi protocol, offering users tokenized exposure to sophisticated yield-generating strategies. Each YToken represents a proportional claim on the underlying assets plus accumulated yield, enabling users to earn returns while maintaining liquidity.
We've crafted two distinct implementations to serve different blockchain environments:
YToken (L1) - Our flagship implementation designed for Ethereum Mainnet, featuring full ERC4626 compliance and our innovative yield vesting mechanism that helps protect users from yield volatility.
YTokenL2 - Our streamlined implementation tailored specifically for Layer 2 networks, utilizing oracle-based pricing to minimize gas costs while maintaining the core benefits of YTokens.

## Review Checklist: Bare Minimum Compatibility
Each of the items below represents an absolute requirement for the Rate Provider. If any of these is unchecked, the Rate Provider is unfit to use.

- [x] Implements the [`IRateProvider`](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/bc3b3fee6e13e01d2efe610ed8118fdb74dfc1f2/pkg/interfaces/contracts/pool-utils/IRateProvider.sol) interface.
- [x] `getRate` returns an 18-decimal fixed point number (i.e., 1 == 1e18) regardless of underlying token decimals.

### Administrative Privileges
- [ ] The Rate Provider is upgradeable** (e.g., via a proxy architecture).
- [x] Other contracts which are part of the `getRate` callchain are upgradeable**. You can find more information
   about the involved contracts in this [tenderly simulation](https://www.tdly.co/shared/simulation/9dc90206-7f4b-4072-a61e-6b742c33294a)

## Conclusion
**Summary judgment: USABLE**

** upgradeable in this context means that:
- The contract is a proxy contract with an implementation sourced from Etherscan and the proxy emitted an "Upgraded" event.
