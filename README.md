# code-review

A collection of smart contract code reviews performed upon friendly request.

NOTHING IN THIS REPOSITORY CONSTITUTES A FORMAL AUDIT, AND CODE SHOULD NEVER BE DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION WITHOUT A FORMAL AUDIT. REVIEWERS ARE HUMAN; MISTAKES WILL BE MADE AND BUGS MISSED. REVIEWERS ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENT THAT OCCURS POST-REVIEW. THIS IS MERELY A FRIENDLY PEER-REVIEW SERVICE AND SHOULD NOT BE TREATED AS A STAMP OF APPROVAL. REVIEWED CODE IS NOT NECESSARILY BUG-FREE. ALWAYS TRIPLE-CHECK BEFORE INTERACTING WITH SMART CONTRACTS, AND DO NOT TRUST REVIEWERS ON THE BASIS OF REPUTATION ALONE.
